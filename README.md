## My process

### Built with

- NextJS
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

My biggest takeaway from this project was component reuse. I was able to reuse the same component for the two different sections of the page. I also learned how to use quite a few new CSS properties that manipulate ordering and positioning of elements.

This project took a few hours to put together and with each project I'm getting faster at building out the pages. I'm also getting better at using Tailwind CSS and I'm starting to see the benefits of using it.


### Continued development

I'd like to continue using tailwind css for styling and also begin to use animations and transitions to make the pages more interactive. I'd also like to continue to use NextJS for building out the pages and hopefully become more familiar with the framework. I'm also going to start using the mobile first approach to building out the pages.
